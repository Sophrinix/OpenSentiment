"Ratings",2014-12-17,"ERIC Bio","Blue Review","Really fun and easy | I Can use this app to find chords that sound good together so I can easy recreate the sound on other apps without trial an error. Being an amateur musician that makes songs come together faster without actually learning how to to play the chords and their different variations or memorizing them. Could be more instruments but you can make them your self as well which is awesome. Only problem is I can not find how to sync my email in the app or general settings. Can some one help me out with that. Thanks."

"Ratings",2014-12-16,"Ultramusicman","Blue Review","All You Need Is... music Theory | At first glance, I thought that this app could be used to convey some basic concepts of music theory. It can but there is a glaring theory error that needs addressing before I can use this app to teach my students. In the key of C, there are no sharps or flats. All is well and good with the app so far. Changing to the key of G, however, reveals the problem immediately. In the key of G, there is one sharp in the key signature; F#. Unfortunately, the app shows F# as its enharmonic equivalent of Gb. There are no flats in this key. This is best seen in 2. KEY CHORDS & NOTES. The keys of G, D, A, E, B, F#, and C# have no flats. They have, in order, one to seven sharps in their respective key signatures. The keys of F, Bb, Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, and Cb have, in order, one to seven flats, respectively. As you can see, there are a few key signatures having sharps that are enharmonically the same as keys that have flats. For example, F# and Gb sound the same but may be expressed by two different key signatures. If you could add this extra level of correctness, your app would become most useful in a music theory class."

"Ratings",2014-10-28,"MuzikAppJunkie","Blue Review","Yes, where is the Audiobus? | I do really like this one, though I have to leave one star off since Audiobus was left off and another simply because I blame the coolness of this app for my regrettable decision to purchase Fiddlewax "Pro". It may not seem fair but when a family of apps like this is released an overpriced and unimpressive addition like the recent Fiddlewax "Pro" to such a family hurts everything that shares its name. That being said I would still highly recommend this one, it has an unparalleled ability to harmonize recorded samples in a truly peculiar manner. Most musicians, regardless of skill level or musical style, would find many interesting uses for this one."

"Ratings",2014-04-02,"HouseOfHomuth","Blue Review","Great interface, Great Virtual MIDI controller, but needs AudioBus | This app blew me away at first with its simplicity and how easy it was to connect to synths and other MIDI compatible music apps. Fiddlewax then becomes your 'remote control' for those apps, with a great display of notes and chords. You can change your key and the notes/chords in that key light up in blue. It's a great way jump in and actually start playing those wonderful music amps hampered by a mini keyboard, and very iPhone friendly. But to do anything more than play around with this app, you need to be able to work with a DAW, and therein lies the problem. With no AudioBus or IAA connectivity, you can control synths that record into a DAW, but you can't start and stop the DAW itself. AudioBus is fast becoming a prerequisite for any serious music app so I assume/hope they are working on it. In the meantime, apps like Synthecaster are 'on the Bus' and work well. However, if Fiddlewax updates, I think I would prefer it to that app because it has chords (if not a huge variety of them) and has an outstanding layout. Really love the MIDI connect toggle on the top of the home screen too. 5 stars as soon as we're on the Bus!"

"Ratings",2014-02-13,"Daniel Haught","Blue Review","Really nice app for chords and notes | Music making apps are a dime a dozen, and rarely offer more than a few minutes distraction. Fiddle Wax is different in that it provides a novel interface for thinking about chord structure and how songs are put together. I'm really enjoying this little app...clearly a lot of thought has gone into it. Highly recommended, especially if you enjoy learning about chords, inversions and the like."

"Ratings",2014-03-10,"knewsmith","Blue Review","Top Marks! | In my previous review I was highly critical of this app.... What a swift response from the developer for putting virtual midi and email midi recording in, my thanks to you. I have just linked via virtual midi to another synth app.....AWESOME... The developer obviously cares a lot about this app, if you love playing music or your a novice, then this app will teach you something new."

"Ratings",2014-02-14,"Josh voice","Blue Review","Useful musicians tool. | A well thought out and a clearly presented way of seeing, playing and understanding keys and their associated chord tones. The record function is an added bonus as I guess most purchasers will be using this app for recording chord sequences. The developers seems to be keen to develop this app and I look forward to further enhancements. Having said that, it does exactly what the developers claim. Worth the money."

Coupled with an easy to use interface and levels of complexity makes it an all round winner. Don't let the name mislead you :-)"

"Ratings",2014-05-01,"Richard Yot","Yellow Review","Has potential | The app is quite interesting and is fun to play with, but needs a couple of things added in order to become actually useful. The first thing it needs is Audiobus and/or IAA support so that it can be used with other music apps, because without that it is only a toy rather than a tool. Additionally, a noise gate is also essential to tame the hiss from the device mic."

"Ratings",2014-05-14,"JustTech01","Yellow Review","Nice looper and effects | Very interesting take on a loop recorder. Adding harmony as you recorder is easy and turns out great results. Nice with vocals but becomes very interesting indeed when recording other instruments and noise sources. Intuitive and fluid operation. Be nice to have level adjustment for each loop after recording and a way to export easily ino a DAW ie Audiobus or ACP. Great stuff."

"Ratings",2014-10-25,"Velanche","Pro Review","The Ideal Music Scratch Pad | I have been waiting for an app like this for years. This really speaks to my visual as well as my musical side. I am really enjoying this app. A lot of thought and effort must have gone into its creation. To have it all on a single interface is quite a feat. The music ideas just come pouring out of my head with very little effort; just a lot of passion. Best of all, I can save my idea as a MIDI file, import it to Logic Pro X, and build on it. It's one of the best apps I ever used, and I highly recommend it without hesitation. Believe me, it's worth every penny. And oh yeah, the developer is pretty responsive too!"

"Ratings",2014-10-31,"MuzikAppJunkie","Pro Stars",1
"Ratings",2014-10-31,"MuzikAppJunkie","Pro Review","Overpriced and underwhelming, still... | Though I am a fan of Fiddlewax Blue for the weird vocal harmonies it can elicit and Yellow is ok enough, this one fell way short of my expectations. This is partially due to the bang per buck Blue & Yellow deliver but mainly hinges on the fact there are much better apps for a much more reasonable price if the primary function seems to be a MIDI controller. I base this on the piddling amount and lousy quality of the onboard sounds. This would not be so irritating but for the understatement of this in the app details and the sloppy oversight of not including the basic ability to record sounds into the app. If both Fiddlewax Blue and Yellow can do this, then why not Fiddlewax "Pro"? I would skip this one given the chance to do it over, especially when there are things like StepPolyArp & ChordPolyPad that are much more useful in this class of music apps. PS- Minus one star for making me repost the same review again... the update addressed none of the very legitimate beefs many should rightly have with this app. Another reviewer was dead on when they referred to this app as basically a song sketch pad, however, not an ideal one in any sense. In my opinion the high price coupled with the fact that there are far better and less expensive song sketch apps that also can function as a midi controller. Most average $5. Other than the ridiculous price, there nothing remarkable about this. SKIP THIS ONE. It really is one of the the most disappointing purchases I have made in the history of my app addiction, which is saying quite a bit."

"Ratings",2014-10-22,"argel1200","Pro Review","Favorite MIDI Controller | Really enjoying this app, especially how the keys are laid out (chords, regular keys, scale, and Autoharp). just wish the drums used MIDI channel 10 (the channel normally used for drums) and that there was an option to use the internal drums even when using MIDI out only. But these are nitpicks for a very well developed 'creativity' app. A lot of thought went into the design and it has become my go to virtual MIDI controller."
