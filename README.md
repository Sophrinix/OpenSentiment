OpenSentiment
=============

Open Sentiment is an open source web app that processes social data directly in the browse via javascript. Drag in CSV files and watch your data come to life with interactive visualizations and analysis.

OpenSentiment allows you to combine multiple streams of data into a single table by using a standardized structure that can span across multiple forms, users, questions/categories, and responses/data. 

The data should be stored in a CSV (comma separated value) file. Each row of the CSV file contains one response/datavalue. This approach seems a bit heavy at first (for example, requiring 10 rows to store a 10 question form per submission), but it keeps the structure flexible for future data sources (or multiple sources).

While CSV doesn't nicely scale to huge datasets, it's usually enough to give a thoughtful overview of complex inputs for initial analysis. OpenSentiment is really designed to give initial insights and thus is not optimized for directly supporting massive datasets.

The CSV data should be in exactly this form, with 5 rows in this order.

```
FormID,Date,UserID,Question,Response
```

Blank lines are permitted, as well as comment lines beginning with "#".

See the example_csv_data directory to get a realisitic sense for what the data looks like.
